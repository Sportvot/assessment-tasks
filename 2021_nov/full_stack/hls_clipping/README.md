# HLS Clipping (FFMPEG Internals Replica)

## Evaluative Goals
The goal of this task is to evaluate how you break down the problem, including its edge cases, using clean, well-structured, and documented code. Hence, you may use any language of your choice.

## Recommended Prerequisite Reading
- m3u8 file format
- FFmpeg

## Problem Description

To design a script that can be executed from the command line that inputs a .m3u8 and outputs a clipped version .m3u8 from a specified `Start Time` and `End Time`.

**Use Case Scenario**: If a user needs to create a 1 min highlight(e.g goal) from 90 min football match stream. 

### Approach

FFMPEG does support this natively. You may run the below command on your machine to get a better sense of the output it generates in `./out`

```bash
# -ss -> start time of the clip in seconds
# -to -> end time of the clip in seconds
# Note: ignore protocol_whitelist arg, its only for ffmpeg
ffmpeg -protocol_whitelist https,file,tls,tcp -i /some/path/original.m3u8 -ss 12 -to 34 ./out/out.m3u8
```

But, to meet the `Evaluative Goals` of this task, you need to design a script(any language) that has the same behavior as the above FFmpeg example.

```bash
# e.g submission script if you were to use node

# -ss -> start time of the clip in seconds
# -to -> end time of the clip in seconds
node my_script.js -i /some/path/original.m3u8 -ss 12 -to 34 ./out/out.m3u8

```

The script you design will analyze the input times(`-ss` and `-to`), select the appropriate .ts segments, chop them if necessary, and then generate an m3u8 that contains the desired clip.

### Procedure
- Read `-ss`, `-to`, and the output path as specified from the command line to your script.
- `#EXTINF:[segment-lenght]` lines in the m3u8 file determine the length of each segment.
- Read m3u8 text file line by line and download the required .ts segments as determined by `-ss` and `-to`
- Chop(using ffmepg) the boundary ts segments as needed (see Input -> Output Example section below)
- Generate the output m3u8 file line by line giving it the relative paths of the downloaded/chopped .ts segments.
- You can use the `FFprobe` command to determine the exact length of the chopped boundary segments and use it as the `#EXTINF` of the boundary .ts segments in the output m3u8 you are generating.
- Play the m3u8 in VLC and verify the clip is correct as specified by `-ss` and `-to`.


## Sample M3u8 (for testing)
- [basketball sample](https://fhp-news-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/sv_task/index_1.m3u8). This can be downloaded and played in VLC.


## Input -> Output Example
[reference image](./images/input_output_sample.png)(based on Sample Testing M3u8 provided above)

- This is an example with `-ss 37` and `-to 72`.
- Notice that the output m3u8 does not have absolute URLs for the .ts segments. This means the .ts segment paths are relative to the path of the output m3u8 locally.
- Red lines indicate that the original .ts segments were chopped, as indicated by the `#EXTINF` for these segments since their length is less than the original 10.01000 seconds. These are the boundary .ts segments that are determined by `-ss` and `-to.`
- White lines indicate that these are just copies of the original ts segments since they do not lie on the boundary.
